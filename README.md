# Omnifood project

> A responsive, modern landing page for **Omnifood** — a fictional healthy meal-delivery subscription service.

## 🔎 Overview

**Omnifood-project** is a static front-end web project that showcases a clean, desktop-first (but optimized for mobile) landing page for a hypothetical food-delivery and meal-subscription service.  
It demonstrates proficiency in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a strong focus on good design, responsiveness, and user-friendly interaction.
